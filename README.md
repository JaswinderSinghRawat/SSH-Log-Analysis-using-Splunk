# SSH Log Analysis using Splunk - Project
## Objective
The goal of this project is to analyze SSH authentication logs to detect unauthorized access attempts, abnormal login behavior, and potential SSH brute-force attacks.

- **Successful SSH logins** (who connected, from where)
- **Failed login attempts** (possible brute-force or password spraying)
- **Multiple failed authentication attempts** (brute-force)
- **Connections without authentication** (potential scanning or incomplete sessions)

By completing this project, I developed practical skills in ingesting SSH logs into Splunk, analyzing them using SPL, building dashboards, and configuring security alerts.
